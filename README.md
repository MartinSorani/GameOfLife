# GameOfLife API

A production-ready API implementation for [Conwayâ€™s Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using C# and .NET 7.0. This project demonstrates how to build a robust, well-tested API with persistence, structured logging, containerization, and comprehensive reporting.

## Features

- **Board Upload:** Upload a new board state (as a jagged array of booleans) and receive a unique identifier (GUID).
- **Next State Calculation:** Compute and retrieve the next generation of the board.
- **Generational Simulation:** Retrieve the board state after a specified number of generations.
- **Final State Retrieval:** Determine and return the final (stable) state of the board with error handling for non-convergence.
- **Persistence:** File-based repository ensures board state is retained across service restarts or crashes.
- **Containerization:** Docker support for easy deployment.
- **Structured Logging:** Uses Microsoft.Extensions.Logging (optionally with Serilog) for high-performance, structured logging.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Includes Unit, Integration, and End-to-End (E2E) tests.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Integrated with Allure for interactive, detailed test reports.
